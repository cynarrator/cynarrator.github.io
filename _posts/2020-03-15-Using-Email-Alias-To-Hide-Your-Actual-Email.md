## Introduction
We all have to deal with spam in our email inbox at some point in our life. We create a new email account in the hope of not receiving any more spam and voila, it happens again, unfortunately. However, that does not mean we cannot try to defend against it.

Email aliases are the temp email that point to your real email. When someone asks you your email address in public, you can give them that aliased account and after you are done, you can remove that alias email. This allows you to be able to recieve emails from someone without giving away your actual email address.

Many people create multiple alias email accounts to sign up for shady websites that they are obliged to sign up, such as Facebook. Using alias email addresses mean that even if that website got hacked or data breach occours, its that alias email they are getting.

Some people do use multiple accounts for that but it makes things unmanaged. Inbox aliases are much cleaner and easy.

## How are they different from temp email service
Well, inbox alias differs from temp email in the following ways,
* Your inbox alias stays permanent for you till you remove it
* The email sent over these alias can be important. You just dont want the sender to know your email address

## How do I use it then

There are many email services that do provide this service though most of them are paid. Here are some that are free,

1: Outlook Alias: This is a free service from Microsoft. Outlook allows you to create a lot of email alias. My email address listed here is also an alias that points to my real outlook inbox. That way my actual email is not compromised.

2: SimpleLogin: Simplelogin is a free online service that allows you to create upto 15 aliases(in a free plan that is) I also use SimpleLogin and it has been fantastic to me

4: <s> InboxAlias: Inbox Alias is another great email aliasing service, check out https://inboxalias.com </s> [They are now out of service]

## Can you really trust these third party companies
Well, that depends on you how far you are willing to take it.
